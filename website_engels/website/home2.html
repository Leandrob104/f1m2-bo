    <h6>History of the museum</h6>
    <h6>
      The Maritime Museum is located in 's Lands Zeemagazijn.
      This monumental building from 1656 was designed by Daniel Stalpaert as a warehouse for the Admiralty of Amsterdam.
      The Zeemagazijn was built when Amsterdam was the largest port in the world.
      Now, more than 350 years later, the Zeemagazijn is still an impressive building with a lot of character.
      The perfect location for Het Scheepvaartmuseum, which has been located here since 1973.</h6>

    <h3>Bert Hamers</h3>
    <h3>Fascinating and interactive museum. Children's section about the whales. The VOC is accessible with many interactive pieces.
      The museum is nicely arranged according to the cardinal points. Very educational. Accessible to a large audience.</h3>
      <h3>Ronald Hoets</h3>
      <h3>Nice museum in a historic building.
        The glass roof over the courtyard is impressive.
        Unfortunately, many areas of the indoor exhibition are empty.
         As a result, many topics about shipping are not or hardly discussed.
         The royal sloop and the VOC ship are the big tractors. Both have been beautifully restored.</h3>
        <h3>Rachida B.</h3>
      <h3>Awesome! Definitely recommended with kids and yet we as adults also have a lot of fun out of it.</h3>
